* I am learning along and I have tried to be as accurate as possible. If you find any mistakes, please let me know. There are some proofs that I may not have included as it was tedious
  or I was lazy. If you want to see the proofs, please let me know and I will try to add them.
* I am using Quarto to write these solutions. If you want to see the source code, please check the .qmd files in the respective folders.
* I have also taken some notes on the course. You can find them [here](my-notes.qmd)
