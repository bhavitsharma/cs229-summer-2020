{\bf Notes:} (1) These questions require thought, but do not require long
answers. Please be as concise as possible.  (2) If you have a question
about this homework, we encourage you to post your question on our
Piazza forum, at \piazza. (3) This quarter, \qtr, students may submit in pairs. If you do so, make sure both names are attached to the Gradescope submission. However, students are not allowed to work with the same partner on more than one assignment. If you
missed the first lecture or are unfamiliar with the collaboration or honor
code policy, please read the policy on the course website before starting work.
(4) For the coding problems, you may not
use any libraries except those defined in the provided \texttt{environment.yml}
file. In particular, ML-specific libraries such as scikit-learn are not
permitted. (5) To account for late days, the due date is \due. If you submit after
\due, you will begin consuming your
late days. If you wish to submit on time, submit before \due.
