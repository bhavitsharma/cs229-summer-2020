\item \subquestionpoints{5} \textbf{Coding problem.}
Follow the instructions in \texttt{src/linearclass/logreg.py} to train a
logistic regression classifier using Newton's Method.
Starting with $\theta = \vec{0}$, run Newton's Method until the updates to
$\theta$ are small: Specifically,  train until the first iteration $k$ such
that $\|\theta_{k} - \theta_{k-1}\|_1 < \epsilon$, where
$\epsilon = 1\times 10^{-5}$. Make sure to write your model's predicted probabilities on
the validation set to the file specified in the code.

Include a plot of the \textbf{validation data} with $x_1$ on the horizontal axis and $x_2$ on the vertical axis.
To visualize the two classes, use a different symbol for examples $x^{(i)}$
with $y^{(i)} = 0$ than for those with $y^{(i)} = 1$. On the same figure, plot the decision boundary
found by logistic regression (i.e, line corresponding to $p(y|x) = 0.5$).
