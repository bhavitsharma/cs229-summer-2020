\item \subquestionpoints{5} \textbf{Coding problem.}
In \texttt{src/linearclass/gda.py}, fill in the code to
calculate $\phi$, $\mu_{0}$, $\mu_{1}$, and $\Sigma$, use these parameters
to derive $\theta$, and use the resulting GDA model to make predictions on the
validation set. Make sure to write your model's predictions on
the validation set to the file specified in the code.

Include a plot of the \textbf{validation data} with $x_1$ on the horizontal axis and $x_2$ on the vertical axis.
To visualize the two classes, use a different symbol for examples $x^{(i)}$
with $y^{(i)} = 0$ than for those with $y^{(i)} = 1$. On the same figure, plot the decision boundary
found by GDA (i.e, line corresponding to $p(y|x) = 0.5$).
